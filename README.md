## ✨ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a stunning mouse scroll animation using **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform). GSAP is a powerful animation library for creating high-performance animations that work across all modern browsers. This animation is triggered when a user scrolls the page, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.

- **Mouse Scroll Animation**: Dynamically responds to mouse scroll events, animating elements on the page.
- **GSAP Integration**: Utilizing GSAP to animate elements with precise control over the scroll behavior.
- **Customizable Animations**: Easily customize and tweak animations for different elements on the page.

## 🔧 How It Works

This project utilizes **GSAP** to animate page elements based on the user’s mouse scroll:

### 1. **Mouse Scroll Event**
- The animation is triggered by the user's mouse scroll, allowing the page elements to move smoothly as the user navigates.

### 2. **GSAP Animations**
- The GSAP library is used to create smooth, fluid animations that are easy to control. Elements animate in response to scroll events with precise timing and transitions.

### 3. **Arrow Image for Scroll**
- The scroll is visually guided by an arrow, providing a visual cue for users to scroll down. You can use the following arrow image to guide your users:
